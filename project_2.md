## Project 2:<br/>

**Part 1: Retrieving and subsetting DHS**<br/>
- After writing a convincing proposal, I was granted acces to Uganda's DHS data. This data provides a comprehesive overview of the population of Uganda.<br/>
- In project 1, we generated De Facto settlement boundaries. De Facto settlements are generated by predictions of where individuals reside based on provided data and have proved to be fairly acurate representations of actual settlement locations and sizes. Polical boundaries, however, are politically established and are not necesarily representative of where people actually live- there are other influencing factors that affect where people actually congregate, which is utilized in generating the De Facto settlements.<br/>
- Within the survey, households fall within enumeration areas (analogous to census blocks) containing a given number of households and people residing in them for each area.<br/>
*Reasons to generate an accurate synthetic population:*<br/>
- Cost efficiency<br/>
- Infrequency of surveying- we can model changes in a population between updates in data or recollection
- Keep up with demand for infrastructure
Synthetic population (multinomial logistic regression and probab)
Donâ€™t want to just replicate sampled units to make 
To ensure this, we will perform a multinomial logistic regression that predicts the dependent variable from a set using the conditional probability for all possible outcomes
We will uge, sex, household size to predict religion
Use these predictions to predict.
etc.
We can visualize the distribution of these categorizations/ measurements using the spatial probability density functions we used to make maps of population density/distribution.
