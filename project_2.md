## Project 2:<br/>

**Part 1: Retrieving and subsetting DHS**<br/>
- After writing a convincing proposal, I was granted acces to Uganda's DHS data. This data provides a comprehesive overview of the population of Uganda.<br/>
- In project 1, we generated De Facto settlement boundaries. De Facto settlements are generated by predictions of where individuals reside based on provided data and have proved to be fairly acurate representations of actual settlement locations and sizes. Polical boundaries, however, are politically established and are not necesarily representative of where people actually live- there are other influencing factors that affect where people actually congregate, which is utilized in generating the De Facto settlements.<br/>
- Within the survey, households fall within enumeration areas (analogous to census blocks) containing a given number of households and people residing in them for each area.<br/>

*Reasons to generate an accurate synthetic population:*<br/>
- Cost efficiency<br/>
- Infrequency of surveying- we can model changes in a population between updates in data or recollection<br/>
- Keep up with demand for infrastructure<br/>

*Progress thus far:*<br/>

# read in the data
uga_pop20 <- raster("/Users/aeraposo/uga_ppp_2020.tif")
uga_adm2 <- read_sf("/Users/aeraposo/Data-440-Raposo/project_1/gadm36_UGA_shp/gadm36_UGA_2.shp")

# DHS data
persons <- read.dta("UG_2016_DHS_09292020_1718_153327/UGIR7BDT/UGIR7BFL.DTA")
households <- read_dta("UG_2016_DHS_09292020_1718_153327/UGHR7BDT/UGHR7BFL.DTA")

# subset desired area
kumi <- uga_adm2 %>%
  filter(NAME_2 == 'Kumi')

# crop and mask the raster
kumi_pop20 <-crop(uga_pop20, kumi)
kumi_pop20 <-mask(kumi_pop20, kumi)

# get total population size
pop <- floor(cellStats(kumi_pop20,'sum'))

# find number of houses (divide total pop by average number of people per household)
houses <- pop/4.7

# subset households in kumi
kumi_sub <- subset(households, shdistrict == 208)
sum(households$hv005)
table(kumi_sub$hv009)

st_write(kumi, "kumi.shp", delete_dsn = TRUE)
kumi_mt <- readShapeSpatial("kumi.shp")
win <- as(kumi_mt,"owin")

# generate a ppp (planar point patter) of households in Kumi, Uganda
kumi_houses <- rpoint(houses, f = as.im(kumi_pop20),win = win)

# plot and save your ppp
png("kumi_ppp_house.png")
plot(win, main = NULL)
plot(kumi_houses, cex = 0.15)
dev.off()
```
- I was able to determine the appropriate columns to subset and the distric number of Kumi by searching my .DO files and reading through the DHS report of the data. I also found the columns for the sex of household members (hv104_01 through hv104_27) and age of household members (hv105_01 through hv105_27).<br/>

*Kumi households:* Here is the ppp (planar point pattern) of household loactions in Kumi:<br/>

*Part 2:*

After some trial and error, I was able to produce a synthetic population and a more accurate plot of household distributions. To recap, I began by reading on my DTS files, which contain people and household data- data including the locations of households, details about the residents of each household, and general qualities of the household (ie, household size).<br/>
Particularly, we used the information collected on individuals' wealth, education, age, sex, household size, and location to inform predictions about these qualities in the synthetic population. After extracting the above information from the household data gathered from a DTA file, I combined the respective columns into a new dataframe called hhs.<br/>

```
unit <- households$hv004
weights <- households$hv005 / 1000000
location <- as_factor(households$shdistrict)
size <- households$hv009
sex <- households[ , 283:309]
age <- households[ , 310:336]
education <- households[ , 364:390]
wealth <- households$hv270
hhs <- cbind.data.frame(unit, weights, location, size, sex, age, education,wealth)
```
Next, I read in several shapefiles that contain geospatial infromation about the various levels of subdivisions within Uganda. The 0-level administrative subdivision (adm0) represents a detail on the scale of the entire country, the 1st level details the districts, and the 2nd level details smaller cities and counties. I also subset my adm1 by selecting pertinent data to the district of Kumi. I used this subset to crop and mask my population raster (a planar point pattern) to just view Kumi.<br/>

PLOT HERE!<br/>

Next, using the floor function, I determined the total population by summing the values in my population raster. I then divided this value by the average household size, which gave me the total number of households. Next, I defined a window based on my adm0, which I used to define the scope of my plots. Using the number of households, I was then able to define the predicted planar locations of these houses based on information stored in the population raster within my defined window. This gave me geographic coordinates of the housholds, which I saved as the variable 'hhs_locs'.<br/>

```
uga_hhs_n <- floor(cellStats(uga_pop20, 'sum') / mean(hhs$size))

st_write(uga_adm0, "uga0.shp", delete_dsn=TRUE)
uga0_mt <- readShapeSpatial("uga0.shp")
win <- as(uga0_mt, "owin")

hhs_pts <- rpoint(uga_hhs_n, f = as.im(uga_pop20), win = win)

pts <- cbind.data.frame(x = hhs_pts$x, y = hhs_pts$y)

hhs_locs = st_as_sf(pts, coords = c("x", "y"),
                    crs = st_crs(uga_adm0))
```

calculated error at the adm1 level: 0.0008717575
