## Project 1: Code Red, computer meltdown in progress

**Creating a Geometric Bar Plot with your Simple Feature object:**<br/>

After my computer took a brief hiatus to delete its own operating system, I was able to start project 1!For this project, I attained my data from [GADM]( https://gadm.org/), which provides geospatial and population data for each country and its subdivisions. I selected Uganda and began by downloading a zip file containing the necessary shapefiles (shp). Shp files contain both geospatial information, in the form of polygons, and descriptive population measurements. After familiarizing myself with the data and producing some base level plots during week 2, week 3 began with making a geometric bar plot with a simple features object
