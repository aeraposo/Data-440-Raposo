## Exploring a new R package:
This week, I researched the mlr3viz package in R. This package was released in January, 2020 and is used to visualize mlr3 objects. 
Mlr3 objects are of the task class, which contains tasks.
Tasks are methods used to work with data without directly changing the DataBackend, which is a package designed to format data into either a table or a matrix, depending on which implimentation you use. Essentially, this package enables data flow from a given form of data storage (ie- a remote database or datasets), which is especially useful when working with large quantities of data and in scaling smaller amounts of data. Particularly, these objects have many applications in machine learning where large and diversified data are required. 


Looks like a seaborn pairplot in python.
Here is one from my final project for Applied Machine Learning, which I took this summer:<br/>
